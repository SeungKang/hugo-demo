As I delve into learning more about programming, it felt right for me to become more familiar with the tools Github and Visual Studio Code. Both are tools I will be using quite frequently.

# GitHub

**Merging** is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent line of development create by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

When you **clone** a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub to your local machine.

**Pull Requests** let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository.

## VS Code
To the left of code written in VS Code is a column called the **gutter**.
- **New lines** are reflected in green.
- **Changed lines** are reflected in shaded blue.
- **Deleted lines** are reflected in a red arrow.

VS Code has a built in feature to compare the differences between versions side by side.
