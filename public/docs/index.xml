      <description>As a starter programming project, I wanted to try creating a discord bot to track the steps collectively taken by a community towards a total community step goal.
I used discord.js, a Node.js module that is used to interact with the Discord API.\
The discord bot is hosted on the site Heroku.
New Terms Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
Open-Source means software where the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.</description>

      <description>My goal for a while has been to create a webiste, but I would get quickly overwhelmed everytime I tried starting. Hugo has been a huge help to get me over that hurdle. I hope to use this website to post my notes. I followed a video tutorial to get myself started using Hugo. [Video Link]
Hugo Hugo makes static websites, static websites load faster than dynamic websites that use things like wordpress.</description>
