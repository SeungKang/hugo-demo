My goal for a while has been to create a webiste, but I would get quickly overwhelmed everytime I tried starting. 
Hugo has been a huge help to get me over that hurdle.
I hope to use this website to post my notes.
I followed a video tutorial to get myself started using Hugo.

A website called Netlify was used to setup a temporary free domain website. The website is handy that it syncs with changes made in the GitHub repository for this website.\

## Hugo
Hugo makes static websites, static websites load faster than dynamic websites that use things like wordpress. I installed Chocolately for package management to install Hugo. Theme I chose is called Fuji.

- Set draft to **false** once the post is ready to be live on website.

## Markdown
- Markdown is a lightweight markup language that can be used to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.
- Use #, ## for headings
- Wrap in * or ** for *italic* and **bold**
- End line with \ for a new line.

## Commands
Start Hugo's development server to view the site. Opens a local server at real time and makes changes in real time at localhost:1313.\
`hugo server`

Make a new post.\
`hugo new post/first.md`
